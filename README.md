# WEP_WPA_Cracking
WPA and WEP are Wi-Fi security protocols. WEP is weak and easily cracked due to static encryption keys. WPA is stronger but can be cracked using brute-force or offline attacks. Strong passwords and regular updates are essential for network security. Unauthorized cracking is illegal and unethical.
